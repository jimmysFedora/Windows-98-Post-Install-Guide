# Windows 98SE Post Install Guide
My personal list of what to after installing Windows 98 Second Edition for gaming and more or less serves as a checklist for my self.

# Hardware tips and requirements:
- If you are unable to run at full CPU clock speed install Windows 9x without ACPI by forcing APM mode via ```setup.exe /p i```
- KEEP PARTITION SIZE TOTAL UNDER WHAT OS CAN SUPPORT
- WINDOWS 95 OSR 2.5, 98 & ME ONLY SUPPORTS UP TO 137GB HDD
- Booting into other drives with operating systems
  - BIOS → IDE HDD AUTO DETECTION → UNUSED DRIVES --> NOT INSTALLED
- ADJUST BIOS SETTINGS BEFORE INSTALLING WINDOWS
- IF HAVING ERRORS WITH BOOTING FLOPPY OR CD MEDIA 
- RESET BIOS SETTINGS
- SOME WINDOWS GAMES USE WDM DRIVERS INSTEAD OF VXD DRIVERS
- FOR BURNING DISKS MAKE SURE BURN SPEED IS 10X IN ISO 9660 FILE SYSTEM
- IF USING EZ DRIVE CREATE FAT32 PARTITION, BEFORE CREATING NTFS PARTITION. IF DUAL BOOTING SYSTEMS LIKE WINDOWS ME AND WINDOWS XP, MAKE SURE FAT32 PARTITION SMALLER THAN WINDOWS XP

# Post install housekeeping
- Add or remove Windows features if not done already
- Install hardware drivers
- Verify DMA Mode is turned on for HDD & CD-ROM in Device Manager
  - If unstable disable DMA mode  
- Configure sound mixer settings
- Set sound output for devices in multimedia to have the highest sample rate conversion
SET PERFORMANCE TAB → FILE SYSTEM → NETWORK SERVE
Defrag IDE HDDs with 
- Remove network login prompt by going to ```Settings → Network → Primary Network Logon → Windows Logon```
- Due to lack of memory optimizations on the 9x kernel it is recommended that after finishing a game restart the computer and then load up the next application.

# DOSBOX TIPS: 
FOR DIRECTORY - MOUNT C (PATH OF DIRECTORY)
FOR CD DRIVE MOUNT (DRIVE LETTER) (LETTER OF ACTUAL CD-ROM) -T CDROM
FOR ISO - IMGMOUNT “DRIVE LETTER” “PATH TO ISO.ISO” -T ISO
FOR CUE/BIN FILES - IMGMOUNT (DRIVE LETTER) (PATH TO CUE) -T ISO
I USED THE DOSBOX VERSION. I HAD TO CHANGE THE CONFIG FILE IN THE INSTALL FROM JOYSTICK=AUTO TO JOYSTICK=CH, AND SWAP34=TRUE THEN SET THE JOYSTICK IN MECHWARRIOR 2 TO THE CH JOYSTICK AND CALIBRATED IT.
```
JOYSTICKTYPE=CH
TIMED=TRUE
AUTOFIRE=FALSE
SWAP34=TRUE
BUTTONWRAP=FALSE
```

# Basic CLI commands: 
- ```cd\``` - Goes back to previous directory
- ```dir /p``` - LOADS IN ALL THE FILES IN THE DIRECTORY IN CHUNKS
- ```dir /w``` - LOADS INFORMATION IN WIDESCREEN
- ```COPY *.* C:\WIN9X``` - MOST COMMON WAY TO COPY SETUP FILES TO HDD 
- ```FORMAT A: /U``` - IF FLOPPY DISCS DON’T WORK TRY LOW LEVEL FORMAT - 
- IF YOU CANNOT FORMAT DRIVE AFTER USING FDISK ON IT. GO TO THE CD-ROM AND CD INTO WIN98 FOLDER THEN RUN ```FORMAT C: /Q /U /S```
