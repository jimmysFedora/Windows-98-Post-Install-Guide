# Windows-98-Post-Install-Guide
My personal list of what to after installing Windows 98 Second Edition for gaming

TIPS & REQUIREMENTS:
TO RUN AT 1GHZ MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL WINDOWS 98SE & ME WITHOUT ACPI USING SETUP.EXE /P I
KEEP PARTITION SIZE TOTAL UNDER WHAT OS CAN SUPPORT
WINDOWS 95 OSR 2.5, 98 & ME ONLY SUPPORTS UP TO 137GB HDD
TO BOOT INTO OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS
GO TO BIOS → IDE HDD AUTO DETECTION → AND TOGGLE DRIVES TO NOT INSTALLED
ADJUST BIOS SETTINGS BEFORE INSTALLING WINDOWS
IF HAVING ERRORS WITH BOOTING FLOPPY OR CD MEDIA 
RESET BIOS SETTINGS
SOME WINDOWS GAMES USE WDM DRIVERS INSTEAD OF VXD DRIVERS
FOR BURNING DISKS MAKE SURE BURN SPEED IS 10X IN ISO 9660 FILE SYSTEM
IF USING EZ DRIVE CREATE FAT32 PARTITION, BEFORE CREATING NTFS PARTITION. IF DUAL BOOTING SYSTEMS LIKE WINDOWS ME AND WINDOWS XP, MAKE SURE FAT32 PARTITION SMALLER THAN WINDOWS XP

JOHNNY 5 HDD CONFIGURATION:
Windows 95
120GB ACTUAL HDD SIZE
137GB HARDWARE HDD LIMIT
137GB PARTITION
Windows 98 SE
160GB ACTUAL HDD SIZE
137GB HARDWARE HDD LIMIT 
137GB PARTITION
Windows ME

DOSBOX TIPS: 
FOR DIRECTORY - MOUNT C (PATH OF DIRECTORY)
FOR CD DRIVE MOUNT (DRIVE LETTER) (LETTER OF ACTUAL CD-ROM) -T CDROM
FOR ISO - IMGMOUNT “DRIVE LETTER” “PATH TO ISO.ISO” -T ISO
FOR CUE/BIN FILES - IMGMOUNT (DRIVE LETTER) (PATH TO CUE) -T ISO
I USED THE DOSBOX VERSION. I HAD TO CHANGE THE CONFIG FILE IN THE INSTALL FROM JOYSTICK=AUTO TO JOYSTICK=CH, AND SWAP34=TRUE THEN SET THE JOYSTICK IN MECHWARRIOR 2 TO THE CH JOYSTICK AND CALIBRATED IT.
JOYSTICKTYPE=CH
TIMED=TRUE
AUTOFIRE=FALSE
SWAP34=TRUE
BUTTONWRAP=FALSE


DOS TIPS: 
cd\ - GOES BACK TO PREVIOUS DIRECTORY
dir /p - LOADS IN ALL THE FILES IN THE DIRECTORY IN CHUNKS
dir /w - LOADS INFORMATION IN WIDESCREEN
COPY *.* C:\WIN9X - MOST COMMON WAY TO COPY SETUP FILES TO HDD 
IF FLOPPY DISCS DON’T WORK TRY LOW LEVEL FORMAT - FORMAT A: /U
IF YOU CANNOT FORMAT DRIVE AFTER USING FDISK ON IT. GO TO THE CD-ROM AND CD INTO WIN9X FOLDER THEN RUN FORMAT C: /Q /U /S
RESET HDD TO FACTORY SETTINGS


WIN9X TIPS:
TO CONNECT TO FILE TRANSFER SERVER RUN FTP://192.168.0.X/
FORMAT USB DRIVES IN WINDOWS 9X
HARDWARE
RADEON 8500DV - WHEN UNKNOWN DEVICES SHOWS UP, CLICK CANCEL FOR THE DRIVER WINDOW AND MAKE SURE TV TUNER DRIVERS ARE INSTALLED AFTERWARD
TRY TO INSTALL DIRECTX VERSION FOR GPU 
HOUSEKEEPING POST INSTALL
ADD / REMOVE WINDOWS SETUP FEATURES - AS NECESSARY
HDD & CD-ROM DMA MODE IN DEVICE MANAGER - VERIFY ON
MULTIMEDIA DEVICES SAMPLE RATE CONVERSION - HIGHEST
CONFIGURE MIXER SETTINGS
SET PERFORMANCE TAB → FILE SYSTEM → NETWORK SERVER
HARD DRIVES - DEFRAGMENTED

AFTER FINISHING A GAME, DON'T START ANOTHER ONE. SHUTDOWN - WAIT 30 SECONDS, RESTART, AND THEN PLAY THE NEXT ONE.
